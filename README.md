# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart-Disease-Prediction:
This web application uses a machine learning classifier trained on heart disease data to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on user input. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, the app provides a simple interface for real-time prediction and evaluation. 
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided medical information.
